      <p>At Stanford, I had the chance to work on Advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer
        Gravitational-Wave Observatory), a super-ambitious project to directly detect
        gravitational waves.  On February 11, 2016, LIGO <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03837">famously announced</a>
        the first ever gravity wave detection!

      <p>As a Graduate Research Assistant, I worked on several projects focusing on
        seismic isolation, ranging from mechanical hardware analysis and optimization
        to software tool development and control loop tuning.

          <p>Using FEA modal analysis, I worked on choosing optimal strut arrangements for
            the beam splitter structure.  We chose to minimize modal mass and maximize modal
            frequency for the lowest two structural modes.  However, we also considered other
            factors, such as the third structural mode, and the modal mass of higher frequency modes.

          <p>Some of the biggest challenges were accurately modeling the fixed constraints in
            FEA, dealing with the space constraints of existing structures, and designing for
            placement in different chambers.

          <p>We demonstrated several strut arrangements, all with significant improvement over
            the nominal design.  To validate the analysis, we performed hammer tap tests on a
            representative structure.  The experimental results agreed very well with the FEA prediction.

      <p>To provide active seismic isolation, several sensors (inertial and displacement)
        are used for the position control of a two-stage active platform.  Depending on
        the system mode of operation, these sensor signals are blended differently (in
        frequency space) to produce a position signal for feedback control.  Switching
        between these sensor blends was done offline and required costly system downtime.
        I helped design and implement the smooth filter switching operation that switches
        from one sensor blend to another in real time.

      <p>To implement real-time blend-switching, we rely on a modified Simulink diagram
        (see image), C code to ramp between blends, and a Perl script to provide
        hierarchical control of the switching.  I worked on the first two tasks.  The
        final result was an intuitive GUI incorporated into the existing MEDM interface
        (see image), commonly used in the experimental physics community.

          <p>I worked on a system identification project for the two-stage active
          seismic isolation platform.  Using a 4th order coupled mass-spring based
          ARMAX model, we were able to successfully capture the system dynamics in
          the desired frequency range of 100mHz to 100Hz. The model's step response
          was close to the experimental response.
