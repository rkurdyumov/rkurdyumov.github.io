PWM Frequency: takes group 0 or 1 and frequency, returns nothing
Multiply input frequency by 2
Create a scaling factor number which will be the desired product of the prescaler and scaler
While Scaling factor can be divided by 2
	Divide the scaling factor by 2 and store it into the scaling factor
	Count how many times the scaling factor can be divided by 2
Set the Scaler Value to be the current value of the ScalingFactor
If group 0
	Set pre-scaler for clock A
Else if group 1
	Set pre-scaler for clock B
If group 0
	switch on the prescaling power and apply the correct bit values to set to the prescaler register
		case 0: divide by 1
		case 1: divide by 2
		case 2: divide by 4
		case 3: divide by 8
		case 4: divide by 16
		case 5: divide by 32
		case 6: divide by 64
		case 7: divide by 128
Else if group 1
	same as above
If group 0
	Use scaled clock A for group A
	Set the ScalerValue for the Scaled Clock
Else if group 1
	Use scaled clock B for group B
	Set the ScalerValue for the Scaled Clock

PWMDutyCycle: takes channel 0-4 and dutyCycle, returns PWMS12_ERR or PWMS12_OK
DutyCycle and Channel Number exceed the maximum, return error
Otherwise, change the Duty Cycle in the DutyCycle register for the respective channel, return OK

PWMPolarity: takes channel 0-4 and direction, returns nothing
	switch on the direction
		case 1 (active HI desired)
			If channel 0, set channel 0 to active HI
			If channel 1, set channel 1 to active HI
			If channel 2, set channel 2 to active HI
			If channel 3, set channel 3 to active HI
			If channel 4, set channel 4 to active HI
		case 0 (active LO desired)
			If channel 0, set channel 0 to active LO
			If channel 1, set channel 1 to active LO
			If channel 2, set channel 2 to active LO
			If channel 3, set channel 3 to active LO
			If channel 4, set channel 4 to active LO
		
PWMOnOff: takes 1 (on) or 0 for each PWM channel 0-4
Turn off PWM and don't map any ports to PWM
Set Polarity for each PWM channel (output initially high)
Set PWMPeriod to have 100 count resolution
For each PWM channel
	Initialize the channel to 0% Duty Cycle
If Ch0 is to be turned on
	Enable Map of PWM to PortT0
	Enable PWM subsystem on Channel 0
If Ch0 is to be turned off
	Disable Map of PWM to PortT0
	Disable PWM subsystem on Channel 0
Repeat for channels 1-4
