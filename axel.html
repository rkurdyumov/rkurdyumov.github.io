      <p>The goal of my Caltech senior thesis was to develop a model of paddle wheel
        soil interaction for the Axel rover, a tethered two wheel robot designed for
        extreme terrain (especially Mars).  I worked on experimental modeling and
        applying the results to motion planning strategies.

      <p>I conducted tests to develop motion planning algorithms that would enable
      Axel to successfully navigate through different soil types and slope angles
      without getting stuck, while optimizing power usage. We found that slip ratio
      increased roughly linearly with increasing wheel speed and increased drastically
      with increased slope angle. Slip ratio was about 2 times higher for loose sand
      than for compact sand. Power usage increased linearly with slope angle, and was
      over 1.5 times higher in loose sand than in compact sand.

      <p>One of the biggest lessons of the project was that the rover is better off crossing
      loose soil than any incline greater than 5Â° (from a power efficiency perspective).
